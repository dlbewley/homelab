= Tools to Help with My Home Lab Setup

[TIP]
I am using https://keybase.io/[Keybase.io] to hold my secrets, becuase it's slightly simpler than https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html[Ansible vault] and I don't have anything fancy like https://www.vaultproject.io/[Hashi Vault] at this time.

== Setup

* link:setup-pyenv creates a virtualenv to satisfy depts for Ansible https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/vmware_guest_module.html[vmware_guest] module like https://pypi.org/project/pyvmomi/[PyVmomi]
* link:requirements.yml includes some helpful roles from https://galaxy.ansible.com/[Ansible Galaxy] like https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhatinsights/insights-client[insights-client]

== Playbooks

* link:mkhelper.yml - Playbook to build VMware VM and prep OS for munging by https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode[RedHatOfficial / ocp4-helpernode] Playbook prior to contributing back to same
* link:infra.yml - WIP Playbook for a persistent Infrastructure host.
